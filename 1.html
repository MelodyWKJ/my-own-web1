<p style="margin-top:45px">I was born in Busan in the Twenty-fourth of August, 2005. And I have been living in Busan since I was born. When I was young, I been to America for a year. <br>But I was so young that I don't have many memories in there. So I always think it's so regretful that I don't have many memories in there. <br>If I had memories in there, maybe my English skill will be better.</p>
